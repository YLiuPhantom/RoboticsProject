# RoboticsProject

Go to hw7code folder - the one we downloaded.

Replace setup.py and package.xml with the one here.

Create a folder named rviz, place project.rviz in the folder.

Go into launch folder, replace old launch with this launch.

Go into urdf folder, add cyton_gamma_1500.urdf

Go into hw7code folder, add project.py

Go into terminal, do colcon build

Then, you can run the code by simply entering: ros2 launch hw7code project.launch.py
(only one terminal needed)

That's it! Feel free to edit project.py. Right now, the robot finds and hits the ball, the ball goes flying, and the sim ends. Let me know if there are issues. Enjoy your Thanksgiving :)
